## Bringing Cloudinary to WordPress

People have tried to bring [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to WordPress, and have really **complicated** the whole thing. The official Cloudinary plugin, in my opinion, is really **clunky and in the way** in most cases. Other solutions follow the same route, and are just too complicated. Since I wasn't able to find a good solution for my needs, I **built one myself**!

### Defining what a good solution is

A good solution should have the following attributes:

1. It should work **out of the box**, with minimal to no configuration
2. It should be easy, **seamless** and out of the way
3. It can be **turned off** and on easily
4. It should be **really extendable**, so developers can really harness it

### Auto Cloudinary Plugin for WordPress

I've built a plugin based on the attributes above: [Auto Cloudinary](https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-cloudinary/). It is a super simple, easy to use WordPress plugin which you can use to integrate your WordPress website to Cloudinary!
