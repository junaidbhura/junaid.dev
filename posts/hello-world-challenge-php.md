How many characters does your programming language need to output the phrase "Hello, World" on a web page? I'll go first with PHP: **12**!

```php
Hello, World
```

That's it!

A more verbose example would be something like:

```php
<?php
echo 'Hello, World';
```

But the beauty of PHP is that you don't need to call it until its needed, which makes it a great companion to work alongside HTML markup.
